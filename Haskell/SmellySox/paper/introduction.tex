Sorted logic. example.

Theorem provers - none exist for sorted logic...

Translate sorted to unsorted! Now we can use any FOL prover.

How to translate?

Some cool example (puzzle? monopoly?)
Do "sort erasure" on example. Show that doesn't work.

Show that we must introduce predicates to make it work.
Say that it is not always necessary.

Explain the need for a calculus to show when it is necessary and when 
it isn't.

Introduce Monotonicity for FOL. Refer to Jasmin's paper.

Say that we have implemented this in a tool called Monopoly and 
that we will explain more about this in sections blah, blah and blah.
