\begin{abstract}
None of the famous theorem provers for first-order logic deal with
many-sorted problems. Ideally, we would like our provers to understand
many-sorted logic, but in the meantime, we want to be able to
\emph{translate} a sorted problem into an unsorted one so that the
usual crowd of theorem provers and model finders can solve it.

There are two obvious ways to do this. One is a) easy, b) efficient
and c) often absolutely wrong, while the other is a) always correct
and b) extremely wasteful. We present a technique called
\emph{monotonicity inference} that allows us to use a mixture of the
two techniques: the efficient one when sound and the wasteful one when
necessary. To demonstrate this technique we wrote a new tool,
Monopoly, the first of its kind as far as we know.
