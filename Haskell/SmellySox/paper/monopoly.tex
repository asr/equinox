\section{Monotonicity inference in practice with Monopoly}

We have implemented the monotonicity calculus as part of our tool
Monopoly.

\subsection{NP completeness of finding a model extension}

  A SAT-problem can be encoded as a problem of finding a model extension
  as follows:

  Each literal l corresponds to a predicate $p_l$ with one argument.
  The literal being true in the SAT-problem corresponds to the predicate
  being extended by true, and likewise if the literal is false in the SAT-
  problem, the corresponding predicate should be extended by false. 
  
  In each clause of the SAT-problem, at least one literal must be true.
  For each clause $(l_1 \vee ...\vee l_n)$, we create a formula
  $$ \neg p_{l_1}(X) \wedge ... \wedge \neg p_{l_n}(X) \Rightarrow X = c $$
  This formula is monotone in our calculus exactly when the variable $X$ 
  is guarded by at least one of the predicates $p_{l_1},...p_{l_n}$.
  Thus, if we can show that there is a consistent extension of the predicates
  which makes the formula monotone, then the original set of propositional 
  clauses is satisfiable.

\subsection{...}

  In the implementation of Monopoly, we use a SAT-solver to find the context 
  in which to extend the predicates. It works as follows:

  For each predicate $p$ occuring in the sorted problem, we create two literals;
  $p_T$ and $p_F$. If $p_T$ is true, then $p$  is extended by true. 
  If $p_F$ is true, then $p$ is extended by false. Since a predicate can only
  be extended in one way, we add to our SAT formula the clause $\neg p_F \vee \neg p_T$.
  If both $p_T$ and $p_F$ are false, this means that $p$ is extended by copying.

  The SAT formula is the conjunction of SAT clauses and the constraint that no 
  predicates of the given sort may be true extended and false extended at the same time.

  The SAT clauses correspond to the clauses of the original formula.
